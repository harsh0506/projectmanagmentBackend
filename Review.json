            "summary": "they have proposed the text summerization technique using bert for abstractive as well as extractive . there datasets are used cnn/daily , new ork times and xsum dtatabases ,first two are extractive and third one is more abstractive . BERT is used for learning from lcontextual meaning of large corpora.For abstractive summerization s2s models are useful.summerization quality is evaluated using Rogue.also human evolution is done.Model performs well on datasets.Document encoing is used . text generation is in future scope . cost of creation incerases so functionality decereses.",
